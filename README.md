 # SVG Logo Maker

## Description

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This app allows you to create your own customized logo where the user can select three letters, letter color, a shape, and shape color, which are then all turned into a SVG file. The node package "Inquirer" is used to prompt the user to select their choices. Then the default fs module writes these results to a logo.svg file.

## Credits

Special thanks to my class mate Tyler Peterson! While I did not get any code directly from Tyler, it was his idea to make a switch-case statement to properly get the users shape.
